Let's benchmark [`toupper`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/toupper.3.html) implementations, because that's a thing you do on Tuesdays.

Actually, I don't really care about `toupper` much at all, but I was writing a different post and needed a peg to hang my narrative hat on, and hey `toupper` seems like a nice harmless benchmark. Despite my effort to choose something which should be totally straightforward and not sidetrack me, this weird thing popped out.

This will be a pretty short one - the longer, original post on the original, maybe far more interesting, topic is coming soon. The source is [available on github](https://github.com/travisdowns/toupper-bench) if you want to follow along.

So let's take a look at three implementations which perform `toupper` over an array of `char`: that is, which take an input array and modifies it in-place so any lowercase characters are converted to uppercase.

The first simply calls the C standard library [`toupper` function](https://linux.die.net/man/3/toupper)[^tubroken] in a C-style loop:

~~~c++
void toupper_rawloop(char* buf, size_t size) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        buf[i] = toupper(buf[i]);
    }
}
~~~

The second uses the [more modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2olsGf6JIkU) approach of using to `std::transform` to replace the raw loop:

~~~c++
void toupper_transform(char* buf, size_t size) {
    std::transform(buf, buf + size, buf, ::toupper);
}
~~~

Finally, the third one is our bespoke ASCII-specific version that checks if the character lies in the range `a` - `z` and remaps it by subtracting 32 if so[^subnote]:

~~~c++
void toupper_branch(char* buf, size_t size) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        char c = buf[i];
        if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
            buf[i] = c - 32;
        }
    }
}
~~~

Seems straightforward enough, right?

Let's benchmark these on my Skylake i7-6700HQ laptop, with the default gcc 5.5. Here's a JPSP[^jpsp] :

![Skylake-S toupper performance]({% link {{page.assets}}/toupper-skl.svg %})

Let's get three observations that aren't really part of the story out of the way.

First, the pattern for the branchy algorithm (`toupper_branch`). It's the only one that varies much at all with input size - the other two are basically flat. This turns out to be just a benchmarking artifact. I use random ASCII input[^randnote], so primary determinant of performance our branchy algorithm is branch prediction. For small input sizes, the branch predictor _learns the entire input sequence_ across iterations of the benchmark and so mispredictions are low and performance is high, [just like this](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/10/16/benchmarking-is-hard-processors-learn-to-predict-branches/). As sequence size grows the predictor memorizes less and less of the sequence until it flatlines when it mispredicts every time there is an uppercase character (0.27 mispredicts per character).

The second thing is this green blob of much slower samples from the `toupper_branch` in the upper left:

![The green blob]({% link {{page.assets}}/green-blob.png %})

This wasn't a one time artifact, I saw those guys hanging out up there across several runs. They don't reproduce if you run that particular size alone however, only when the script runs to collect input across all size values. They don't always show up. I didn't look into it further but my best guess is some of unfortunate collision or aliasing effect perhaps in the branch predictor or in the 4k physical to virtual page mapping (VA space randomization was off, however).

The third not interesting thing is the bimodal behavior of `toupper_rawloop` -- the blue dots form two distinct lines, at just above 2 cycles per char and a faster line at 1.5 cycles per char. All performance counters that I checked were the same between the two "modes". The fast mode, which runs at 1.57 chars/cycle is basically bottlenecked on the load ports: there are 1.54 uops/cycle going to both port 2 and port 3, so those ports are 98% occupied. The slower mode I can't explain.

While I was investigating it, the fast mode suddenly stopped appearing and I was stuck in slow mode. Maybe my CPU saw what I was up to and downloaded a microcode update in the background to remove the inconsistency, but I still have the SVG to prove it (for now).

So what's the interesting thing?

The interesting thing is that the raw loop version runs 3x to 4x faster than the `std::transform` version: 1.5 to 2 cycles per character versus just above 7 cycles per character.

What's up with that? Are my standard algorithms letting me down? Does `std::transform` have some fatal flaw?

Not really. Well, not at all.

It turns out these results occur when the functions are compiled in [separate](https://github.com/travisdowns/toupper-bench/blob/256bb8318444faa8411ca6a9b11dcf4396f9ee81/impls-noalgo.cpp) [files](https://github.com/travisdowns/toupper-bench/blob/256bb8318444faa8411ca6a9b11dcf4396f9ee81/impls-algo.cpp). If you put them into the same file, suddenly the performance is is the same: they both run slowly.

No, it's not an alignment thing.

It gets weirder too: the fast raw loop version, compiled in a separate file, _slows down if you simply include the `<algorithm>` header_. That's right - including that header, which is never used and generates no code in the object file, slows down the raw loop by 3 to 4 times. Conversely, the `std::transform` version speeds up to full speed if you copy and paste the `std::transform` implementation out of `<algorithm>` and stop including that file.

It gets _even_ weirder (this is the last "it gets weirder", I promise): including `<algorithm>` doesn't always do this. The slowdown happens if `<algorithm>` is included before `<ctype.h>`, but not if you swap them around:

**Slow:**
~~~c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <ctype.h>
~~~

**Fast:**
~~~c++
#include <ctype.h>
#include <algorithm>
~~~

In fact, in my case, this performance anomaly was triggered (in a different project) when clang-format sorted my headers, moving `<algorithm>` to the top where it belonged (hence the clickbait title).

Of course, we were going to end up mired in assembly at some point. Let's not postpone the pain any longer.

Here are are the [fast and slow](https://godbolt.org/z/DwZBJM) versions of the functions[^fsnote], with the core loops annotated:

**`<algorithm>` included first:**

~~~nasm
toupper_rawloop(char*, unsigned long):
        push    rbp
        push    rbx
        lea     rbp, [rdi+rsi]
        sub     rsp, 8
        test    rsi, rsi
        je      .L1
        mov     rbx, rdi
.L5:
        movsx   edi, BYTE PTR [rbx]  ; load a char from *buf
        add     rbx, 1               ; buf++
        call    toupper              ; call toupper(c)
        mov     BYTE PTR [rbx-1], al ; save the result to buf[-1]
        cmp     rbp, rbx             ; check for buf == buf_end
        jne     .L5                  ;
.L1:
        add     rsp, 8
        pop     rbx
        pop     rbp
        ret
~~~

**With `<algorithm>` second:**

~~~nasm
toupper_rawloop(char*, unsigned long):
        test    rsi, rsi
        je      .L7
        push    rbp
        push    rbx
        mov     rbp, rsi
        mov     rbx, rdi
        sub     rsp, 8
        call    __ctype_toupper_loc
        lea     rsi, [rbx+rbp]
        mov     rdi, rbx
.L4:
        movsx   rcx, BYTE PTR [rdi]        ; load a char from buf
        mov     rdx, QWORD PTR [rax]       ; load the toupper table address (pointed to by __ctype_toupper_loc)
        add     rdi, 1                     ; buf++
        mov     edx, DWORD PTR [rdx+rcx*4] ; look up the toupper result by indexing into table with the char
        mov     BYTE PTR [rdi-1], dl       ; store the result
        cmp     rsi, rdi                   ; check buf == end_buf
        jne     .L4                        ;

        add     rsp, 8
        pop     rbx
        pop     rbp
.L7:
        rep ret
~~~

The key difference is the slow version simply calls `toupper` in the loop, while the fast version has no function calls at all, just a table lookup[^aliasing] - the body of `std::toupper` has been inlined.

Examining the glibc [source](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=ctype/ctype.h;h=d17f727cf0dc2a0f6c62fa50aff799b175dcb426;hb=2a764c6ee848dfe92cb2921ed3b14085f15d9e79#l205), we find the implementation of `toupper`:

~~~c++
__extern_inline int
__NTH (toupper (int __c)) // __NTH is a macro that indicates the function doesn't throw
{
  return __c >= -128 && __c < 256 ? (*__ctype_toupper_loc ())[__c] : __c;
}
~~~

We see that `toupper` is implemented as an `extern inline` function that first checks that the range of the char fits within a byte[^bcheck] and then looks up the character in the table returned by `__ctype_toupper_loc()`. That function returns a thread-local pointer (a `const int **`), which in turn points to a lookup table which given a character returns the uppercase version[^nobran].

So now the assembly makes sense: the fast version of the algorithm inlines the `toupper` body, but it can't inline the `__ctype_toupper_loc()` call[^inline2]; however, this call is declared `__attribute__((const))` which means that its return value depends only on the arguments (and here there are no arguments) and so the compiler knows it returns the same value every time and so can be hoisted out of the loop, so the loop body has only a few loads associated with the lookup table, the store of the new value to the buffer, and loop control[^faster].

The slow version, on the other hand, leaves the `toupper()` inside the loop. The loop itself is one instruction shorted, but of course you need to run all the code inside `toupper` as well. Here's what that looks like on my system:

~~~nasm
  lea    edx,[rdi+0x80]                   ; edx = rdi + 0x80
  movsxd rax,edi                          ; zero extend c
  cmp    edx,0x17f                        ; check that c is in -128 to 255
  ja     2a                               ; if not, we're done
  mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rip+0x395f30]     ; lookup TLS index
  mov    rdx,QWORD PTR fs:[rdx]           ; access TLS at index
  mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rdx]              ; dereference TLS pointer
  mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rdx+0x48]         ; load current toupper lookup table
  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rdx+rax*4+0x200]  ; lookup c in LUT
2a:
  ret
~~~

Since it's a standalone function call, it has to do more work. There are no less than _five_ chained (pointer-chasing) memory accesses. Only two of those accesses remained in the fast loop, because the rest were hoisted up and out of the loop. The input to output latency of this function is probably close to 25 cycles, so out measured throughput of ~7 cycles means that the CPU was able to run several copies in parallel, not too terrible all things considered.

Why does this happen?

Through a long series of includes, C++ files like `<algorithm>` include `<bits/os_defines.h>` which has this line:

~~~c++
// This keeps isanum, et al from being propagated as macros.
#define __NO_CTYPE 1
~~~

When `<ctype.h>` is ultimately included, this prevents the block containing the `extern inline` definition of `toupper` from being included:

~~~c++
#if !defined __NO_CTYPE
# ifdef __isctype_f
__isctype_f (alnum)
// lots more like this
__isctype_f (xdigit)
# elif defined __isctype
# define isalnum(c)	__isctype((c), _ISalnum)
# define isalpha(c)	__isctype((c), _ISalpha)
// more like this
# endif

// the stuff we care about
# ifdef __USE_EXTERN_INLINES
__extern_inline int
__NTH (tolower (int __c))
{
  return __c >= -128 && __c < 256 ? (*__ctype_tolower_loc ())[__c] : __c;
}

__extern_inline int
__NTH (toupper (int __c))
{
  return __c >= -128 && __c < 256 ? (*__ctype_toupper_loc ())[__c] : __c;
}
# endif

// here's where tolower is defined as a macro
# if __GNUC__ >= 2 && defined __OPTIMIZE__ && !defined __cplusplus
#  define tolower(c)	__tobody (c, tolower, *__ctype_tolower_loc (), (c))
#  define toupper(c)	__tobody (c, toupper, *__ctype_toupper_loc (), (c))
# endif /* Optimizing gcc */

#endif /* Not __NO_CTYPE.  */
~~~

Note when including `<ctype.h>` from C++ `toupper` is _never_ defined as a macro - at most it is `extern inline` - the macro definitions below that are guarded by `!defined __cplusplus` so they'll never take effect.

So I'm not sure if the `extern inline` bodies of `tolower` and `toupper` are intended to be excluded by `__NO_CTYPE` in this case, but that's what happens and this has a significant performance impact in this toy loop. As a corollary, if you include `<cctype>` rather than `<ctype.h>` (the C++ version of the C header which puts functions in the `std::` namespace) you also get the slow behavior because `<cctype>` ultimately includes `<bits/os_defines.h>`.

_Does this matter?_ Nah, not the performance bit anyway.

`toupper` is broken for serious multilingual use and, if you only care about ASCII you can write your own faster function. If you care about proper text handling, you are probably using UTF-8 and you'll have to use something like ICU to do locale-aware text handling, or wait for C++ to get Unicode support (you might be waiting a while). It's only interesting in clickbait sense of "clang-format can cause a 4x performance regression".

On the other hand, I suspect that including standard headers in different orders should _not_ change the declarations like that, and there are other differences beyond `toupper` and `tolower`. That's probably a bug, so I have filed one [against libstdc++](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100128). So while we can hope this specific issue might be fixed in the future, no doubt the scourge of include order affecting semantics will be with us more or less forever.

_Does this happen on all libc versions?_ Mostly yes, but it gets complicated.

The above results apply directly to gcc 5.5 and glibc 2.23, since that's what I used, but things get weirder on newer versions (starting around glibc 2.27). On newer versions, the issue as described above occurs between `<algorithm>` and `<ctype.h>`, but additionally `<stdlib.h>` enters the picture[^anwho]: if you include `<stdlib.h>` before `<ctype.h>` you'll enter slow mode, which doesn't happen on earlier versions. So apparently `<stdlib.h>` also ends up defining `__NO_CTYPE` at some point on these newer versions[^andy]. At least here we can't blame clang-format sorting -- it might _fix_ the issue for by sorting headers (in files where you aren't including any other problematic header).

[^andy]: So yes, it happens because newer stdlib.h, when included from C++, actually includes not the "C" stdlib.h, but a C++ stdlib.h _override_ file which includes a bunch of stuff including `<bits/os_defines.h>` before ultimately including the base "C" stdlib.h.

### Thanks

Thanks to HN user ufo who [pointed out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21579483) you don't need a lambda to adapt `std::toupper` for use in `std::transform`, and Jonathan Müller who subsequently [pointed out](https://twitter.com/foonathan/status/1197051249822195712) that in fact you do want a lambda.

Thanks to Andrey Semashev who pointed out [in the comments](#comment-05cb0120-9612-11eb-9ec2-33c79e181b6f) some additional details of what's going on and recommended re-filing the bug against libstdc++ rather than glibc.

<br>

[^tubroken]: Yes, `toupper(3)` from `<ctype.h>` is basically irreparably broken for most non-ASCII use, because it cannot handle multibyte characters, but it is good enough for our purposes. We only feed it ASCII strings.

[^subnote]: ASCII conveniently locates lowercase and uppercase characters 32 positions apart, meaning that converting between then is a simple matter of adding or subtracting 32. In fact, if we were sure that all our input were ASCII letters, we could just unconditionally clear the 5th bit, e.g. `c & 0b11011111`, which would lower any uppercase and leave lowercase unchanged. Of course, we can't rely on inputs to be letters, so we need the range check to avoid clobbering non-letter `char` values.

[^jpsp]: Err, that would be a _Jittered Performance Scatter Plot_. This is basically a scatter plot with some interesting parameter on the x-axis (in this case, the size of the input) and performance (in this case, cycles per character, _lower is better_) on the y-axis. The main feature is that each x parameter value is sampled multiple times: here the benchmark is repeated 10 times for each size

[^randnote]: In particular, characters are chosen uniformly at random in the range `[32, 127]`, so the if statement in the function is true ~27% of the time.

[^fsnote]: Specifically, I'm showing the generated code in both cases for the raw loop version, the only difference being the order of include of `<algorithm>` and `<ctype.h>`. The source generated is basically the same for all the fast and slow variants: e.g., the `std::transform` version generates basically the same slow and fast assembly as shown if you use it through `<algorithm>` or "copy and paste", respectively.

[^aliasing]: Even the fast loop isn't as fast as I could be, as the lookup table pointer is redundantly reloaded (`mov rdx, QWORD PTR [rax]`) inside the loop. That table pointer would change when the locale changes, but it is not updated during the loop so it could be hoisted. Perhaps the compiler can't prove that because we are writing a `char` array (which could in principle alias `[rax]`, the table pointer), but even `__restrict__` doesn't help. A different version of the loop which just sums the `toupper` values and doesn't write to a char array [does receive this optimization](https://godbolt.org/z/Kb6pc8) - the load of the pointer is moved outside the loop.

[^bcheck]: This range check doesn't leave in the trace in the inlined assembly, because the compiler already knows that `char` values will always fall in the range `[-128, 255]` - it is needed only because the API to `toupper(c)` takes an `int` value rather than `char` so people could pass any old `int` value but the lookup tables are only sized for `char`, so this check is needed to avoid out-of-bounds accesses.

[^nobran]: Incidentally, this shows why the `std::toupper` routines don't show any dependence on input size: they don't use branches (except for the range-check branches which will predict perfectly), but rather a branch-free lookup table.

[^inline2]: This call could not be inlined even if you wanted to: its body is not available in the header.

[^faster]: A simple lookup table will be faster than the "fast" version using `std::toupper` since it doesn't have to mess around with the extra indirection to get to the table. `toupper_lookup` illustrates this approach and runs at 1.32 cycles per byte. Of if you _really_ cared about this, a vectorized approach would be at least 10x as fast again.

[^anwho]: I'm not really picking on `stdlib.h` (or `<algorithm>` for that matter) - it is entirely likely that all C++ headers, and possibly many more C headers also trigger the behavior, but I didn't test for that. I was including `stdlib.h` just to get the definition for `size_t`.
