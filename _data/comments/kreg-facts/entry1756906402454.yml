  The reason CPU is hitting brakes at 95% fill of PRF could be because it
  reserves few entries for a 2nd thread if it support hyperthreading/SMT. Some
  out of order structures reserve few entries for forward progress as well, in
  the event one op comes in non-speculatively. But PRF allocation might not be
  out-of-order, so that might not apply here.
