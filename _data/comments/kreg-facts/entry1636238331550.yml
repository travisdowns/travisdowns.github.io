  I made an error with my testing - I used Henry Wong's method of

  `mov edi, [rdx + rdi * 4]`

  `kaddd` etc

  `mov esi, [rdx + rsi * 4]`

  `kaddd` etc

  loop branch


  and added a lfence after the second mov, but forgot to remove the second group
  of filler instructions. After fixing it, I get similar results with both
  methods, but lfence is cleaner as you note. However, I only see 114 mask regs
  (kaddb) on the Xeon 8171M with either robsize or my own code. I get 126 with
  kaddd, but that's still not 134. Perhaps there's some weirdness with using a
  cloud VM.
