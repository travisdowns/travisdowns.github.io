  Hi Robert,


  Thanks for your comment. I did some tests with `xnorb k1, k1, k1` and some
  variations, but didn't find any anomalies. The instruction itself seems to
  execute like any other `xnorb` (so no indication of a "ones idiom" in analogy
  with "zeroing idiom"), and when subsequently using it with masked AVX
  instructions, I didn't find any difference. Of course, my tests were not
  exhaustive!


  In general, masked operations with D or Q element width execute in the same
  time as their unmasked counterparts, while B and W widths suffer a latency
  penalty: they always take at least 3 cycles (IIRC) even if the unmasked
  operation takes 1 cycle. Some have additional penalties: e.g., 512-bit
  byte-granular masked stores are significantly slower than any other
  granularity or width of stores.
