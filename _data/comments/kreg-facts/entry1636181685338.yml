  Hi Chester,


  The rob-size tool supports: with and without lfence, based on a command line
  parameter. 


  Using lfence is just a way of cleaning separating each iteration of the test:
  nothing crosses the lfence, so either the 2 loads go in parallel or they
  don't. 


  Henry's original version didn't use lfence, so you just rely on the fact that
  the loads form two alternating dependency chains to avoid more than two loads
  overlapping. 


  IME the lfence approach produces a somewhat cleaner plot and approaches or
  matches exactly the known structure sizes in more cases, but the difference is
  usually small. There is some non-ideal behavior near the transition point for
  most structures. 


  How big is the gap you are seeing for kreg lfence mode?
