  Do you have any insight into why the prefetch is to the next element _plus
  one_? Naively, it seems like we should prefetch the next output position
  instead of skipping one element. But then if +1 works, then why not +7 or +8
  to try to fetch the next cache line?


  It feels like secret magic to me.
