message: "What is \"this\"? The comment system on this blog? It is described [over here](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html).\r\n\r\nIf you want to automatically approve comments, that's possible: it's just a setting in staticman. I have the approval enabled as a form of moderation, but since I've gotten almost zero spam comments, I think maybe I could take that out and maybe let the comments be posted immediately."
