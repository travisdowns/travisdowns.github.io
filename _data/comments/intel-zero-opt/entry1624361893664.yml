  Quick question regarding Graviton performance. ARMv8 has an explicit
  instruction to zero out a cache line (DCZVA). Do you know if std::fill or
  memset have a short circuit for the case where the value to fill is zero which
  defaults to using DCZVA. I assume it would improve zero-fill significantly,
  although obviously, it is not a dynamic feature.
