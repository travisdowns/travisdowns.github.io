  Hi Travis, Nice Work! BTW I noticed one more interesting thing from your
  experiment on non-silent drops, on StackOverFlow. I redesigned a small
  experiment based on your code on StackOverflow: I first filled the entire L2
  full of random data, then I CLFLUSH all the data filled in. Now, we should
  have a completely empty L1D and L2. Then, I read 32KB(512 64B Cacheline)
  buffer data into the CPU. I noticed that THERE are ~500 L2_Silent Eviction
  during this reading. I loop the experiment 1000 times and this behavior shows
  up at every time. 


  This is Weird because L1 and L2 should be completely empty before each 32KB
  read, so where are these 500 lines of silent eviction coming from? xD That
  might be another question we dont know and worth investigating in the future? 


  Anyway, Thank you so much for the great work!
