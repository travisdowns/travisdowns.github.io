message: "Are you under the mistaken impression that I'm trying to do a server workload comparison or something like that?\r\n\r\nI'm not. I'm running these tests only to probe this specific uarch effect and single-thread is ideal for that. As a side effect, I made some notes on single threaded performance, but I'm not doing multi-threaded numbers here because none of that is the point.\r\n\r\nThat said, single thread memory bandwidth is pretty important for server loads too: because it usually predicts well for 2, 3, 4 threads, etc. Not all server loads are pushing memory to the limit on every thread (in fact, I'd argue most don't)!\r\n\r\nIn any case, using all the cores produces quite boring results on any decent server, whether it's AMD, Intel or ARM: you reach some significant fraction of the implied maximum memory bandwidth, unless you screw up NUMA placement or something. Graviton is no different: IIRC it gets within 85% or 90% of the peak, based on tests run by others. You don't me to run those *again* â€“ this is about a cool thing Intel is doing in their memory subsystem, not a server shootout."
