message: "I doubt `std::fill` has a special case itself, because the standard library implementations rarely seem to use platform specific code to improve performance, relying instead on compiler transformations. Now, the compiler [can transform](https://godbolt.org/z/GMqfhrs1h) `std::fill` to `memset`, and `memset` _does_ have a DCVZA [path in glibc](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/17a73a6d8b4c46f3e87fc53c7c25fa7cec01d707/sysdeps/aarch64/memset.S#L103) at least!\r\n\r\nSo it would be interesting to see how much difference this makes."
