message: "Re: footnote 8: indeed, `std::fill(0)` vs. `std::fill(1)` with compile-time constant values can make very different code: https://stackoverflow.com/q/42558907/224132\r\n\r\nstd::fill(0) gets inlined a REP MOVSB on some GCC versions, but GCC doesn't do memset pattern recognition for patterns wider than 1 byte and can only auto-vectorize fill(1) the normal way.  (Like for a runtime-variable value)."
