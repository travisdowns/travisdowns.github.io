  Hi JWang,


  The multiplication unit _is_ pipelined on modern Intel CPUs (going back [at
  least to
  Conroe](https://uops.info/table.html?search=imul&cb_lat=on&cb_tp=on&cb_uops=on&cb_ports=on&cb_CON=on&cb_measurements=on&cb_doc=on&cb_base=on),
  and can sustain 1 multiply per cycle. So the four multiplies in each iteration
  have a steady state inverse throughput of 4 cycles, best case.
