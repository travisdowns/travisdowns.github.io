message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have tested the store-on-port-7 \"hack\" (with simple addressing on write).\r\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/PPutUu\r\n\r\nHowever, gcc seems to have problems with this code if you try to add loop unrolling `-funroll-loops`, which is also crucial when you try to achieve maximum performance when using AVX/FMA intrinsic.\r\n\r\nWith clang I'm able to generate unrolled and vectorized code with simple addressing, but it looks like gcc is incapable of this.\r\n\r\nThis thread: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=88760\r\nis discussing some shortcomings in gcc compared with clang.\r\n\r\nYou don't happen to know if it is possible to generate unrolled and vectorized code with simple addressing?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n- Jp"
