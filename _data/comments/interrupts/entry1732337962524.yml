  nice article, but quite hard for me to understand. I know some concepts of
  computer architecture, but I feel some preliminary knowledge is lacking.

  ```

  So when the mov finally retires, there will be two cycles of retiring blocks
  of 4 nop instructions before we get to the next mov:


  the retirement of mov instructions are “execution limited” - i.e., their
  retirement cycle is determined by when they are done executing, not by any
  details of the retirement engine. The retirement of the other instructions, on
  the other hand, is determined by the retirement behavior: they are “ready”
  early but cannot retire because the in-order retirement pointer hasn’t reached
  them yet

  ```

  Such words are unfamiliar to me, could you provide some introductory materials
  for new learners ?
