  I think the only place this will end is where the Burroughs engineers were
  trying to tell the shared hardware advocates in the late 60s.  The only secure
  (running) hardware is hardware that never shares resources between processes. 
  Back then the argument was cost.  RAM and CPU time was prohibitively
  expensive.   Cost won over security only because all users on any particular
  system could be trusted and inter system networking didn’t exist as now. Now
  the shared resource model is breaking down in the face of an entire world of
  potentially hostile users aimed at any particular machine. It’s not
  sustainable.
