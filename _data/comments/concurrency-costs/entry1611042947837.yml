  An interesting thing about restartable sequences is that the critical section
  only needs to be atomic s.t any interrupt to the processor at any time
  returning RIP to the abort handler needs to be graceful. On x86_64 for example
  this means your commit instruction could be an AVX2 store (so 32 byte atomic
  operation percpu which in itself is pretty cool). But there may be a way using
  Travis' investigation of [where interrupts
  happen](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2019/08/20/interrupts.html) to
  build a multi instruction commit if all the instructions retired at the same
  time.
