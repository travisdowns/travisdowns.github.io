message: "Hi Andrew!\r\n\r\nNo, I haven't measured those but a couple of other people asked too, so I might go ahead and do it. I wouldn't be surprised to see some V-only transitions: it is entirely possible that three or more license levels still exist, but that they just aren't evident only by checking frequencies. \r\n\r\nSome information from Intel at Hot Chips also indicates that ICX (ICL server) has very low transition times, even for frequency transitions, so it would be interesting to see if this applies to ICL too and seems like something that would be good news for you if you're concerned about latency."
