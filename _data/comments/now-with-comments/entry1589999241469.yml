message: "Sorry, I can't help you debug it.\r\n\r\nIn general, staticman is a \"batteries not included\" solution that will probably, at some point require some basic debugging on your part. Familiarity with html and javascript (including node.js) is a plus. If you run into a specific, reproducible issue you could consider [filing an issue](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/) on the staticman repo, although as a free project you can expect that the current maintainers may not always have the time or energy to look into specific issues."
