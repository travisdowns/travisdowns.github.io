message: "No, I can't tell you why it's not working without any details.\r\n\r\nYour best approach is to file a bug [against staticman](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/) after checking that your error isn't also mentioned/solved in an existing issue.\r\n\r\nInclude full details of your error message, how you generated your keys, whether it works if you disable reCAPTCHA, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally note that a while ago I changed the `ssh-keygen` command to include `-m PEM` which is necessary to get the right key format in newer versions of openssl. If you used the command without that, you can try regenerating your keys."
