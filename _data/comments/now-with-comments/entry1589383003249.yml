  In the comment form and comment list, instead of just using page.slug, you
  should slugify it, for me slugify: "ascii" is safe enough. The reason is that
  comments are stored in a directory named after the "slug" you pass to
  Staticman in the comment form, I suppose it is page.slug, if that slug
  contains special characters then these characters will be altered and/or
  discarded by Jekyll when it reads that directory name. Then when you use
  page.slug again in the comment list, Jekyll doesn't find any comment for that
  slug, thus no comment is displayed
