message: "Yes I figured it out! It was a really silly issue: my `assets/main.scss` was missing the Jekyll \"top matter\" thing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\n# this is mandatory :(\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I think it was getting ignored by Jekyll entirely. I'm not 100% sure yet how Jekyll works, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking it might be nice to modify the comments style a little. I'll enjoy seeing what you come up with. And I'll let you know if I make any changes myself!"
