message: "Thanks a lot for this well made detailed guide. I do have a couple of questions tho!\r\n\r\n- Everything is working properly except that, my comments aren't showing at all. I tried moderation on and off, i can see the PRs, i merged the PRs, but nothing is showing on my blog. Do you have any idea ?\r\n\r\n- When i submit a comment, the 'Pending' message is always shown with or without moderation enabled. Also, when i click on the link it takes me to your own site. Where can i change that?"
