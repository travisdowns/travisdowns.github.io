message: "I also suffered from this - what worked for me was copying the RSA private key manually(!) from the file on my computer to the config vars in the Heroku settings dashboard (make sure you copy everything inline, so there are no spaces/enters).\r\n\r\nFor example: -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----ABCDEFGHIJK.........XYZ-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
