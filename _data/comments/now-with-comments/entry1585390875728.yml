message: "I have an issue with the display of comments, I tried to post a comment and I have it on in the _data/comments/{$my_post_file_name}/ folder but it doesn't appear.\r\nIt seems that the test site.data.comments[page.slug] in comments.html failed. May I miss something in the configuration file or maybe because I have the '+' character in the filename of the blog post?\r\n\r\nThank you."
