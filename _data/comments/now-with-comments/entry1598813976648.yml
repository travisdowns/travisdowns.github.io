message: "Thanks Travis, this post is very informative! I spent about 10 hours on making everything work and this post helped most. I did not find a single place, other than your post, that explained I need an RSA key to self host staticman, not even in the official document. :-(\r\n\r\nExcept that\r\n1. staticman has moved to Github Apps on v3. The process is a little bit different.\r\n2. Now the private keys can (and must) contain newlines. It seems octokit/app updated their code.\r\n\r\nAnd reCaptca is annoying since I run uMatrix."
