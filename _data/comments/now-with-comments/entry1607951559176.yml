message: "Thank you for such a thorough tutorial. It works!\r\nThe only problem is I do not get the message of a successful comment submission. It shows a message \"Sending...\" and disappears. However, it works fine on a test website. Probably, there is some js conflict. I am still figuring it out...\r\nI also wonder if someone tried to use `staticman-netlify-function` on Netlify, instead of Heroku?"
