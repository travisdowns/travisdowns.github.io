  Hi Travis, I really appreciate your help. The problem is related the Bootstrap
  modal. When the modal container has a fixed or relative position or is within
  an element with a fixed or relative position, the modal window appears
  underneath the grey fade and is noneditable. I fixed this problem by replacing
  the showModal function call with Sweetalert2. Thanks again for your awesome
  post!
