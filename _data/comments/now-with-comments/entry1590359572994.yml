message: "Great post and tutorial on getting Staticman up and running via Heroku. Took some time, but I was able to get comments up and running on one of my Jekyll sites hosted on Netlify.\r\n\r\nThe only place I had a problem was getting Heroku to accept my RSA Private Key via the command line. I'm a Heroku noob and, because the suntax in your post was different for the variable on the RSA key than for the `${braidge_app_name}` and `${github_token}`, it took me quite awhile to figure out I needed to run `cat ~/.ssh/staticman_key | tr -d '\\n'` in my command line and use the output in the Heroku command.\r\n\r\nEverything else was pretty much a breeze. Thanks again for a super post!"
