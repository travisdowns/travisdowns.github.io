message: "Hi, augussst.\r\n\r\nI'm not really able to diagnose staticman or HTML issues here. If you think your problem is with the staticman server, I'd recommend taking a look on their github repo.\r\n\r\nIf you think instead the problem is more likely to be with the HTML or javascript necessary to integrate the form, try StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
