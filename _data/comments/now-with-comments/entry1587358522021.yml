message: "I never set up a webhook due to laziness and I just click \"delete branch\" every time I accept a reply (not actually sure which is lazier, obviously the webhook will pay off if I get a lot of replies, but so far that's not the case).\r\n\r\nSo I don't know anything about the webhook. However, maybe your problem is the trailing slash: try with `v1/webhook` not `v1/webhook/`"
