message: "Super helpful, thanks! I've used this to add comments on a couple sites of mine.\r\n\r\nBut I'm having an issue with one thing! I'm trying to add a new field to the form (It's a question field, and if they get the question wrong then the form errors). I'm able to do this if I add it as name=\"question\" and then validate it via js. But if I add it as name=\"fields\\[question\\]\" and add \"question\" to the allowedFields, I get an error \"INVALID_FIELDS\". Is there a step I'm missing for adding in new fields?\r\n\r\nConfused and confused,\r\nRyan"
