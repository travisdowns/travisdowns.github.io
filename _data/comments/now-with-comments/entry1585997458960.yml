message: "Hi Travis, Dug replying to Dug here. Just to say I'm going to go through the installation again line by line double-checking against your instructions.\r\nOne thing that would be useful is a debbuging method. Current status is I'm getting the \"missing block\" config file error, which I think you listed as a Staticman issue? I'll get stuck in a bit later but all pointers welcome:-)"
