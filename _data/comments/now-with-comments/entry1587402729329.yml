  Travis - You guessed right. I changed `v1/webhook/` to `v1/webhook` and the
  not-found problem cleared up. I started getting notification emails from
  MailGun. This mailhook provides two services: It deletes unneeded branches
  *and* it launches a notification email to people who have subscribed. This
  second feature isn't mentioned in the Staticman documentation for webhooks.
