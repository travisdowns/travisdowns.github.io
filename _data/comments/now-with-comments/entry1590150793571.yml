message: "Thanks Travis, I really **LOVE** your tutorial. I am able to set up comment section on my own site following your instructions.\r\n\r\nBut I also face the same issue that when clicking “submit” the message, about “pending” shows up as it should, but the webpage goes “greyed out” and the message about the comment being pending is not clickable. I just want to check what is the behavior on your site."
