  I am not sure what is going on. I'd start looking at the [code
  here](https://github.com/travisdowns/travisdowns.github.io/blob/master/_includes/comments.html#L3):
  this is where the comments are rendered. Check to see what `page.slug` is and
  if the data files as expected under that slug. Perhaps something is wrong with
  the matching based on the slug. 


  Does your page name have any special characters, spaces, etc? Search on this
  page for `slug` and you'll see several comments which might point you in the
  right direction, especially the one that says I should be slugifying my slug.
