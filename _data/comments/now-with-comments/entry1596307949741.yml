message: "Ah right.\r\n\r\nSo when your site gets generated, I think Jekyll has three high level behaviors for files appearing in the source repository:\r\n\r\n- Files that are copied \"as is\" to the output (the \"output\" is your static site, ready to server, by default the `_site` sub-directory), like stuff in `assets` say png files.\r\n- Files that are not copied at all: this is anything with an underscore prefix, like `_sass`\r\n- Files that are \"processed\" by Jekyll: this end up as part of your site, but after processing my Jekyll. E.g., you wrote your post as a `foo.md` file and Jekyll processes it and creates a `foo.html` with the markdown transformed to html, the post template applied, etc. Processing is triggered when the file has front matter (the `--------` stuff).\r\n\r\nProcessing includes transforming scss to css and copying it to `_site/assets` So stuff in the `_sass` directory like `main.scss` won't  get into your site at all without front-matter.\r\n\r\nThat's how I understand it, at least!"
