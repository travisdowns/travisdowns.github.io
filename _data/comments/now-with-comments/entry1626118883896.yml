  In principle, kramdown has support for LaTeX, using the `$$ your formula here
  $$` syntax and MathJax by default, but I haven't included any of the required
  JS for it to actually render client side. I do miss math layout support
  though, and I'm thinking of adding it, but likely via Katex, pre-rendered to
  HTML rather than Mathjax + HTML.
