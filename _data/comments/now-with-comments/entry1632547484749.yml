message: "Hi Travis, \r\n\r\nthank you for such a detailed tutorial! I was able to deploy my heroku website successfully and followed all the steps you listed except for creating a bot account. I also didn't add a main.scss for now, as having comment style/css is least of my concern. After spending enough time on just the recaptcha, staticman, and heroku setup I just wanted to see if the comment actually work/show up but I dont see them on my website.  :(\r\n\r\nI added this code: \r\n\r\n{% if page.comments == true %}\r\n  {% include comments.html %}\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\nto my default.html which is my 'theme' page that applies to all my html pages but the comment section is shown on none of them. I put it inside a <div> and the end of my default.html before the footer. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if I could get some help. \r\n\r\nMy first thought is that it has something to do with the conditional if page.comments == true, I am guessing it's not 'true' for my 'page' which is why comment section is not showing up. How do i check?"
