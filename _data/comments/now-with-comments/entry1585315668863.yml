message: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThanks for this guide, as the main site of staticman is out of date, sadly even by following your instructions, I can't make it work for my blog. My bridge application on herokuapp.com always returns me errors, so I can't generate the encrypted secret key for recaptcha,...\r\n\r\nI hope that you can tell me why this is not working for me."
