message: "Right, so this is kind of the least standard part of the integration, because unlike the API bridge, the data format, the integration with GitHub and so on, how you want to do this depends a lot on how you generate your blog, and how you want the comments section to look, etc.\r\n\r\nStill, I tried to cover [the case of integrating it with a typical Jekyll blog](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html#integrate-comments-into-site). This is the integration I used: you have to copy the supporting files to your repository, and the modify some part of your post template or foot or whatever to include the comments.\r\n\r\nIs there any particular part you are stuck on? Note that I'm neither an HTML, CSS or JavaScript expert (which probably shows in the relatively vanilla appearance of the integration)."
