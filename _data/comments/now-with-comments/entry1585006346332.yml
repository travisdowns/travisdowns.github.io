message: "Actually, I think that's consistent with footnote 8, but perhaps there is some confusion. Assuming that by \"via the Github linked\" you mean that you accepted the invitation sent to your email, then I think your experience is as expected.\r\n\r\nThat is, you only need to accept the email invite *or* do the `v2/connect` thing because they serve the same purpose: to accept the invitation for the bot to become a collaborator to the repository. If you accepted the invite via email, you don't need to go to the `connect` URL: and if you do, you'll get the \"not found\" error since there is no waiting connection."
