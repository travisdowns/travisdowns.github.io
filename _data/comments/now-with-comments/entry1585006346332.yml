message: "Actually, I think that's consistent with footnote 8, but perhaps there is some confusion. Assuming you by \"via the Github linked\" you mean you accepted the invitation sent to your email, then I think you experience is as expected.\r\n\r\nThat is, you only need to accept the email invite *or* do the `v2/connect` thing: they serve the same purpose: to accept the invitation for the bot to become a collaborator to the repository. If you accepted the invite via email, you don't need to go to the `connect` URL: and if you do, you'll get the \"not found\" error since there is no waiting connection."
