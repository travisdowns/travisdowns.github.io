message: "First of all, thanks for the very details post!\r\nI want to mention my experience which went against footnote 8: I initially accepted the invitation from the bot account via the Github linked but kept invitation not found when trying to connect it. Then i came across [https://www.flyinggrizzly.io/2017/12/setting-up-staticman-server/](https://www.flyinggrizzly.io/2017/12/setting-up-staticman-server/) which says I should not accept it so after I tried removed the bot as a collaborator and tried to connect again it worked\r\n\r\nOnce again thanks"
