message: "Hi, congrats on the success of this beautiful integration.\r\nI am relatively 'new' to static websites and jekyll, including integrating with APIs. \r\n\r\nI currently have Staticman running as a local server via localhost or 0.0.0.0\r\nI have setup a simple HTML form to post to http://localhost. \r\n\r\nThe question I have is: how will I know the localhost POST and GET are working? I want to have the localhost development working before submission to public domain. \r\n\r\nI have kept eye out on the terminal for any changes after submitting the form. Maybe, I need to understand the flowchart more on how each piece speaks to one another for both local and remote hosting."
