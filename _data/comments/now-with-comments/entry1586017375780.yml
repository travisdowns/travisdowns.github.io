message: "Hi Dug,\r\n\r\nSo that \"missing block\" error shows up for a lot of different problems due to bugs in the staticman error handling. You can get more detailed info using a fixed branch rather than staticman/master, but I'll respond more on [issue 345](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/345) which I think you opened on this.\r\n\r\nYes, any newlines in the comment reply breaks the formatting in the pull request. I'm pretty sure the staticman project would happily accept a PR to fix that! I think it's just a matter of escaping (markdown style) the newlines when generating the text for the PR."
